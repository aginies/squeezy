# Squeezy #

## Note ##

As of 2014-01-04, I (Steve Blott) see that Phillip Camp has done some further work on this project.  His work is available [on github](https://github.com/pssc/squeezy).

I suggest you look over there for the most up to date version.

## Description ##

Squeezy is a command-line utility for controlling squeezebox network audio players via their squeezeserver.  It is written in perl and has been tested on Unix and Unix-like platforms.  Squeezy uses the squeezeserver's telnet/CLI interface.

Squeezy is ideal for:
> - command-line control of squeezebox players

> - scripting-based control of squeezebox players

> - crontab-based control of squeezebox players

For example, squeezy can be used to turn players on or off, have them sleep, control their volume, control what they're playing and a whole bunch of other stuff.

The feature set pretty much matches my own needs, so you may find some must-have features missing.  Let me know, it's pretty easy to add stuff.  Or better still, send me a patch!

(Aside:  I've had my squeezeboxes since 2005 and the buttons on some of the remotes have failed.  I now use squeezy most of the time and rarely touch the remote controls.)

The project code is available via 'subversion' under the 'Source' tab or under the 'Download' tab.
